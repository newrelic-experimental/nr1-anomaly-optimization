## Getting Started
First, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command(s) (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number, if not, the commands won't be recognized):

```bash
git --version
npm -v
```

Next, install the [NR1 CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [this link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) and following the instructions (5 minutes or less) to install and setup your New Relic development environment.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:newrelic-experimental/nr1-anomaly-optimization.git
cd nr1-anomaly-optimization
npm install
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf [--profile=<PROFILE>]
nr1 nerdpack:serve [--profile=<PROFILE>]
```

**Pro Tip: run `nr1 profiles:list` to see what profiles (accounts) are available to serve to.**
